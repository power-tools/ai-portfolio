# Iterative Prompt Improver
*Took this idea from Reddit and awesomeprompts-gpt*

### I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you. I will provide you a prompt, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)
